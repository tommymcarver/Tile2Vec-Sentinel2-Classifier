# Tile2Vec-Sentinel2-Classifier
This repository contains an implementation of the unsupervised learning technique Tile2Vec, where the theory learned in Word2Vec that words in similar context have similar meanings, is applied to geospatial relationships. This project expands upon that idea using Sentinel2 satellite images to train the neural network, as well as a MLP softmax classifier.
